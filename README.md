##  bweh mat karna see this dhyan se
- Apply **early** – many private colleges offer **early bird scholarships** or merit quotas based on JEE + 12th.
- Always ask for **"JEE Merit Quota"** or **"Academic Direct Admission"**, not "Management Quota".
- Mention both **JEE Main (70%)** and **12th score (83%)** – many colleges consider both for discounts or eligibility.
- Hostel costs can be avoided if you opt for nearby **PGs (₹6k–₹9k/month)** in most cities.
- Perform well in the 1st year – some colleges give **fee waivers from 2nd year** based on performance.

#ALL MEDIAN RANGES FROM 4-6 LPA,(some are gteater but unme direct ka pata ni bina management quota ka denge ya ni)


if you can afford (16-17 lacs) consider this, warna you can consider elsewehere too, but mai kya kahunga pata hai?? ho paye to ye lelena as you said udhar bhi 12 lac, lag jayega, and also if you wanna save some money ask your bangalore mausa mausi location, and see colleges in that area, that way you can save on hostel and complete enhinerring from bangalore at price of any outside kilkata colleges you might have takeen (12-13 lacs), not to say the opportunuties in bangalore, tho this might be my agenda speaking ki youll be there too lmao but 70% sachme ye better hoga.. okay khatam ab
